## Top skills (most relevant for placements)
- Machine Learning (supervised/unsupervised, model selection, evaluation)
- Deep Learning (CNNs, transfer learning, optimization)
- Computer Vision (classification, preprocessing, OpenCV pipelines)
- NLP & Transformers (tokenization, embeddings, transformer basics)
- Generative AI / LLM apps (RAG basics, prompt engineering, chatbot UX)
- Python (ML stack, APIs, automation)
- Model evaluation (metrics, error analysis)
- Deployment basics (Flask/Streamlit apps, practical hosting)

## Evidence (skills → where used)
- Computer Vision + CNNs → Brain Tumor Detection
- Sequence modeling / temporal modeling → Gait Recognition (CNN→LSTM)
- LLM app building + UX → Groq-Powered LLM Chatbot
- Full product workflow → Heal-Bridge AI
- Regression + feature engineering → Food Delivery ETA
- Classification + explainability → Customer Churn (SHAP)
